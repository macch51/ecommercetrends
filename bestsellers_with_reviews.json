The design is both stylish and practical, making it perfect for work, the gym, or on-the-go errands.\n\nWhat stands out the most is its impressive insulation\u2014it keeps my drinks ice-cold for hours, and I\u2019ve even noticed my coffee stays hot longer than with other tumblers. The sturdy handle and secure lid make it super convenient to carry around, and I haven\u2019t had any issues with leaks.\n\nThe large capacity is a game-changer; I no longer need constant refills, and it helps me hit my hydration goals easily. If you\u2019re looking for a durable, high-quality tumbler that looks great and works even better, I can\u2019t recommend this one enough!",

And then I took a long car trip, and wished that my water bottle could fit in the cup holder, where I could easily access it. After that, the idea of owning one grew on me more and more.\nAfter being gifted one last year, and ever increasingly finding myself making use of it as time went by, I thought that just the one was plenty.\nUntil a few months ago, when I finally decided that maybe getting an extra would be a good idea, as I hated to be without it even long enough to give it a needed wash and air-dry.\n\nIt\u2019s greatly reduces risk of spills, especially for anyone who is concerned about having drinks anywhere near to electronic devices (computers, phones).\n\nIf you put ice in it, it can stay cool, or cold, depending on how much ice you put in it, for a long time.\n\nEasy to clean, the lid can come apart (a bit hard to separate, but this also means it\u2019s not doing so by accident), and the size is perfect. It can be a little heavy, but that is because of how sturdy and well-insulated it is.",

Unfortunately, I cannot trust it will not leak in my bag, but at least it encourages me to drink water and it keeps my water cold so if I get a migraine I can still wake up to a cold beverage.\n\nI had a few issues with getting a scratched-up Stanley and one where the paint was coming off even with light washing (I use a special soft sponge and am super careful with my Stanley, so this was shocking to me), but the third one I got at least until the time of this writing has been really good! I hesitated to write a review for that reason, but now that enough time has passed without incident, I figured I could do so. I absolutely adore it and I keep it by my side at all times when I'm home, so I can drink more water, as someone who suffers from chronic migraines and requires a lot of hydration. It is super cute so that makes me want to drink it more. Sometimes, you have to trick yourself into doing your \"musts,\" and make chores fun.\n\nIt is, of course, absolutely iconic too. Even if the Stanley craze has gone by, I sincerely love the cup, and the fact it was a wild trend was completely incidental for me.",

My nutritionist suggested that I get a cup that would keep my water cold (since I only like it that way) and that had a straw to help me get more fluids in. After looking at a lot of different cups, I finally decided on this one.\n\nI normally wouldn't spend this much on a cup. I do think it is pricey. But, having used it for a while, I now think it is well worth the money. My ice water stays cold until the last drop, even overnight. And using the straw has increased my fluid intake a lot. I had a hard time getting even a cup of water each day and already I'm up to about 5. Aside from a cup of coffee in the morning, water is all I drink so being able to increase my water intake by that much is a big improvement.\n\nI probably won't be one of those people who buy cups to match my outfit, but I've definitely been converted into a Stanley cup fan. I love that it doesn't sweat on the outside and that it is easy to clean all the parts. For me, it has definitely been worth the investment.",

            "review_title": "Finally we BOTH can sleep comfy!",
            "review_comment": "So for years my boyfriend has always liked \u201cjersey sheets\u201d or \u201ctee shirt\u201d sheets or sheets made of flannel. He says he doesn\u2019t like the feeling of cold \u201csilky\u201d feeling sheets as he\u2019s always cold. I\u2019m opposite and am always hot, and anytime we stayed in a nice hotel I looked forward to being able to sleep on cooler, taught, soft sheets for a couple of nights. I was able to deal with our old sheets but the issue we both hated was after awhile any sheet we got would get pilling. We even splurged and got a $60 flannel sheet which did the same thing forcing me to shave off these little annoying fuzz balls that make it feels like there is thousands of crumbs on the sheets. I also would wash our bedding once a week because the Jersey sheets seemed to \u201cgrow\u201d as we move around in bed making it so the sheet was not taught and super annoying to lay on. The day I would wash them they would be comfortable but ultimately by the end of the week they would be almost hanging off our mattress. I ordered these sheets on a whim and got them the same day and immediately just threw out the jersey sheet and put this on (I didn\u2019t even wash it, I know it\u2019s gross but I was desperate for a comfy nights sleep and they came around 8pm) when I put them on I realized how soft and comfortable they felt. I also liked how the pillow cases are larger than most pillow cases that I have had in the past. We\u2019ve been using these sheets for about a week and I love how I don\u2019t wake up with my pillow popping out of the case anymore. The sheets have loosed ever so slightly since a week of sleeping but still are really taught and comfortable. They are cooler than flannel or fabric sheets and are initially cold when you first lay on them but I wouldn\u2019t consider them \u201ccooling\u201d but they keep me from feeing extremely hot. They are way better than I ever would have expected for the price. I look forward to laying on them at the end of each day, even my boyfriend laid in bed the day I got them and said \u201cwow I didn\u2019t think I would like sheets like this, these are so soft!\u201d And fell asleep immediately. We ended up ordering a second set in grey and the color is pretty. I still have yet to wash them, I usually use 2 tide pods when washing the bedding but I might get some fabric softener (as I hear it helps with pilling) to prevent the possibility of having that happen to these sheets in the future. I am hoping they hold up well after the wash and longer use. If they start to pill after wash, I will come back and update my review. Until then, I would highly recommend these sheets for the quality and the price point that they are offered at. Honestly, at this point even if they pill months from now I probably wouldn\u2019t even be upset as long as they stay the same price I would just buy another set as they are just that comfortable and soft.\nUPDATE: So it has been about 3 months since I have purchase and used these sheets. They are still as soft as the day I first put them on. I\u2019ve been washing them bi-weekly along with my comforter and pillowcases. I wash them with warm water using a combination of tide pods and added Downy fabric softener. They say to hang dry them in the description but I have been putting them in the dryer on medium and have been taking them out after around 20-25 minutes, they seem to dry extremely quickly. They have yet to have absolutely any pilling  and also have not shrunk or stretched. Also I have a cat that is very active and also sleeps with me who enjoys kneading on my bed and I haven\u2019t even noticed any signs of wear what so ever to the eye or to the feel. I highly recommend these sheets. I still have yet to even open the second set I purchased!",

We washed ours when we first received them before we even put them on the bed. Washed them according to the instructions on the tag and they held up great. No pilling at all, not even a loose string anywhere. We love them and highly recommend! My husband gets hot when he sleeps always, and these definitely do their job on the cooking part too.

This is spoiled me and made me realize I need to take better care of my bedding and buy better sheets.  I tend to have a lot of night sweats.

Every week it was the same. Strip the bed. Wash the sheets, dry the sheets, remake the bed. Over the 2 years my one poor set of sheets took a beating. They saw countless menstrual cycles, various cold and flue viruses, dogs, and sleep overs. I meticulously washed and  bleached those sheets until one day I took them from the wash and noted that they were beyond bleaching or stain removal. There were dying.... They were dying gray.\n\nI searched high and low. Went to target and TJ Maxx... But to no avail. Why... Why were simple square pieces of fabric $50.00!?!?!? I could not afford this. I could not justify the spending of $50.00 on plain white fabric. So I searched. I searched high and I searched low Until I came here...\nTo The Amazon.\n\nIt was here. Here I discovered them. Plain white sheets at a modest and affordable price.\n&#34;Don't buy them! You'll regret it! You need Egyptian cotton!&#34; My mother said.\n\n&#34;No! I care not what cotton they be! All I need are sheets! I have no one to impress! No one who shares my bed! I am a lowly virgin promised in matrimony to another with a sworn vow of chastity! I care not for fancy sheets!&#34; I shouted.\n\nSo I bought them. I made my bed and I laid in it. And I can tell you that yes... They are I fact sheets that you can sleep in.",

I have been getting more leary of the offerings on Amazon due to increasing bad experiences, but this was a good purchase for our home because the clear material has no pores so it does not hold soap residue and the thickness makes it easy to do general cleaning without damaging the grommet connections.  This is a very thick and clear shower curtain, but way better than the frosted ones that have texture which holds soap residue - the last one we bought turned pink in a few months and would not come clean.  It was disgusting even right after being cleaned because of the pink hue.  Then it began to show mildew stains that would not come off even with scrubbing both sides.  Finally tried using a bleach solution and the material became brittle which is weird.  I would recommend and buy again.",

It will billow slightly, but not all the way into the tub.\n\nOrdered another one.",

This pillowcase is a true game-changer for anyone looking to improve the quality of their sleep and the health of their hair and skin.\n\nFirst off, the satin material is incredibly soft and smooth. It feels luxurious against my skin, and I\u2019ve noticed a significant reduction in hair frizz and tangling since I started using it. Unlike cotton pillowcases that can cause friction and breakage, the satin allows my hair to glide over the surface, preventing split ends and reducing bedhead in the morning. I\u2019ve also noticed my skin feels softer and less irritated, as satin is gentle on the face and helps reduce sleep lines.\n\nThe 20x30-inch size fits perfectly on my queen-sized pillow, and the silver grey color is sleek and elegant, adding a touch of luxury to my bedroom. The pillowcase is well-made, with strong stitching and a smooth, high-quality finish. It\u2019s also easy to care for \u2013 I\u2019ve washed it several times, and it retains its softness and smoothness without any signs of wear.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a simple way to upgrade your sleep experience and give your hair and skin a little extra love, I highly recommend the Bedsure Satin Pillowcase. It\u2019s affordable, comfortable, and really works wonders for hair and skin health. This pillowcase is a total game-changer for a better night\u2019s sleep and more beautiful mornings!",

I feel like using these in the long run will result in less wrinkles and irritation for my face. I also noticed that my hair is growing out softer because of less rubbing. These are great to use if you love a cold feeling pillow. I do wish however that instead of a side opening, that there was an opening in the middle of the back side instead (I feel like those style pillowcases keep the fluff of the pillow better), but it\u2019s not a deal breaker for me at all considering the price. I just throw these in the wash and have yet to notice any pilling. But the fabric is the type that if you snag it, it will show. Also, the fabric will \u201cstain\u201d if you get oils on it, but they are so affordable that again, not a deal breaker to me. I also like how they come in an assortment of colors.",

I am SO tired of having spots to cover and I'm in grad school with a mildly disabled kid and busy life overall, no time for the dermatologist right now. Last time there they recommended an OTC face wash that helped but not 100%. I've used these on more \"regular\" pimples I've already tried popping but I knew there was more there and I use them on new bumps that are deep under my skin (cystic? I think) and would take a long time to surface and then heal. I don't care what dermatologists say (one of my BFFs is one) I have to pop mine to get it all out before they start to heal. Often I have a more solid blockage that needs to be removed. These have eliminated ALL that. A red spot often remains for a few days after using the patch but there was clearly white on the patch and it's no longer raised or irritated. Easy to cover with makeup. I've used this on spots and not found any white on the next day but it still reduces the swelling and irritation. My husband can't see them on me 90% of the time too. When I put them on at night I wash and moisturize and wait a few min before putting the patch on but a few times I was too tired and rushed it. They still stayed on even if the edges weren't perfect. I used these on my 11 year old whose just starting to get some mild breakouts. I have VERY sensative skin and these don't irritate me at all. I've even used them during the day on weekends to speed things up if I wasn't going anywhere. So cool noticing the white spot slowly increasing as it works. Or feeling the spot reducing on those times no white gunk is drawn out. Im even attaching a picture (sorry) to show it working. I don't know what sort of magic is in these but try them, I think you'll love them too!",

I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t create these 20 years ago! Sure, you could use paper towels, but some do leave little paper towel hairs on your face, or are too thin to wipe makeup off and will break. I do think these have a nicer quality, and you can use them to get extra make up, mascara, etc. It\u2019s really better than using a dirty towel to dry your face, especially if you\u2019re trying to keep breakouts to a minimum. My daughter swears that when she runs out of these that she starts to break out because she\u2019s using her towel to dry her face. I have them on subscription and get a little bit of a discount. They are pricey, but it beats having to spend a lot more at a dermatologist if this helps with your teenagers acne prone skin.",

I'd say it's not very gentle, as it will leave your skin feeling dry, but if you pair it with a moisturizer you should be fine. Smells very chemically, sometimes will irritate your eyes.

It leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed, tackling multiple concerns at once.\n\nThat being said, one important note is to rinse it off completely. If any residue is left behind on your skin, it can transfer onto towels or clothing and cause stains or bleaching. I learned this the hard way, so I now make sure to rinse thoroughly to avoid damaging my towels.\n\nOverall, this is an excellent product for both acne management and body odor control.

Tried almost all of the trending face washes on instagram and TikTok such as cerave, laroche-posay, cetaphil, vanicream, and so much more. I discovered this product 3 years ago and have used it religiously since. It makes my combination skin so smooth, and prevents breakouts. It is PERFECT if you pair it with an oil cleanser, as it is a little thick and has a hard time cleaning out the sebaceous filaments in your pores (I recommend DHC cleansing oil). The product can also be a little drying! So make sure you pair it with good products that replenish your skin moisture barrier (hyaluronic acid, good moisturizer like Laroche-posay or pods). And finally, yes it does bleach things!!! I combat this with buying white towels, and rotating my bath towels between the same 3 so I don\u2019t bleach all of them! Trust me, the bleaching thing is worth it for crystal clear skin! This product does irritate my husbands skin a little but, but he has SUPER sensitive skin. Like the kind of sensitive that we have to buy him special laundry detergent. So if your skin is THAT sensitive, I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product. :)\n\n(Please enjoy the photos highlighting my pimple free face :))",

Sometimes, I just want something easy and quick, and these **Neutrogena Ultra-Soft Makeup Remover Wipes** have been a total lifesaver.\n\nFirst off, they work *really* well. I wear waterproof mascara, and usually, it takes a lot of scrubbing to get that stuff off, but these wipes just melt it away without me having to tug at my skin. And they're super gentle around the eyes, which is huge since that area is so sensitive. I didn\u2019t have any irritation, which can happen with other products, especially when I\u2019m tired and don\u2019t want to deal with anything harsh.\n\nWhat I love most is how **moisturized** my skin feels after using them. I don\u2019t feel like my face is tight or stripped of moisture like with other makeup removers. There's no greasy residue, but my skin feels soft, smooth, and refreshed. I\u2019ve also noticed that I don\u2019t need to rinse my face afterward, which is a total time-saver, especially at night when I just want to crash into bed.\n\nHonestly, these wipes are perfect for people who don\u2019t have a solid skincare routine (like me!) or anyone looking for a fast and easy way to take off makeup without all the extra steps. I can\u2019t say enough about how convenient they are\u2014grab a wipe, swipe away the day\u2019s makeup, and you're done. No fuss, no mess.",

It gives my lashes a false-lash effect that\u2019s perfect for both everyday wear and special occasions.\n\nWhat really sets this mascara apart is its lightweight formula.

It adds volume and length without looking overly dramatic, making it perfect for everyday wear.\n\nApplication: The brush is perfectly designed to coat each lash evenly without clumping. The formula glides on smoothly, allowing for easy layering to achieve the desired intensity. However, be mindful of applying too much, as it can weigh down your lashes.\n\nLongevity: It stays put all day long without smudging or flaking, even through long hours and various activities. I didn't experience any issues with it running or causing raccoon eyes, which is a huge plus for me.\n\nFormula: The formula is lightweight and doesn't weigh down my lashes as long as you apply it in moderation. It's also gentle and didn't irritate my eyes.\n\nPackaging: The packaging is cute and practical. The unique design with the green detailing makes it easy to spot in my makeup bag.\n\nOverall: This mascara is an absolute game-changer. It provides the natural volume and length that I love, stays put throughout the day, and doesn't irritate my eyes.

The formula is incredibly hydrating without being greasy, absorbing quickly into my skin and leaving it feeling soft and smooth all day. The scent is light, fresh, and subtly coconut-y, making it perfect for everyday use without overpowering any fragrances.\n\nWhat I really appreciate is how it nourishes my skin without leaving a sticky residue. It\u2019s great for both my hands and body, and I\u2019ve noticed a real improvement in my skin's texture and moisture levels since I started using it. Plus, the bottle is sleek and easy to use, so I can take it with me on the go.\n\nOverall, the EOS Coconut Waters Lotion is a winner in my book \u2013 it\u2019s affordable, effective, and smells amazing. I\u2019ll definitely be repurchasing! Highly recommend!",

            "review_comment": "My package was delivered on time and honestly it is a really good lotion, however, the lotion itself felt rather warm but that\u2019s probably because it\u2019s like 90\u00b0 outside; when I\u2019d first used it, it reminded me of like yogurt kind of? It only reminded me of yogurt because I heard on tiktok that some people said that\u2019s what the smell had reminded them of. Honestly, it did smell underwhelming at first, maybe it was just a bad batch, but after i had let the lotion cool in my freezer it smelled heavenly. I got used to the smell after a few hours and now I constantly keep smelling myself it\u2019s addicting. Now, I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the best scent ever and it is kind of overhyped but if you\u2019re looking for a lotion that is subtle yet smells flavorful you should totally get it. The lotion smells very rich, creamy, sweet, yummy, and overall very scrumdiliumtious; especially when you apply it. On the other hand, it does smell kind of bitter or sour like a yogurt or milk from time to time so based on first impressions I\u2019d say I wouldn\u2019t have liked it. Like if someone were to wear this and hug me i\u2019d think they smelt a bit weird you know but overtime it starts to smell good in a way I don\u2019t know how to explain it. If you see this review and you still want to try it I warn you that it may smell either bad or good; it depends on the person honestly. Personally, I love it like a lottt but i do think it could use a stronger enhanced vanilla scent; so I am going to add some essential oils and add it into my bodycare routine to smell so edible and yummy. I\u2019d say the lotion pairs well with most body oils, mists, perfumes, etc that al compliment that vanilla rich creaminess with a sweet and delicious flavor. If you are planning on using it alone only I\u2019d say to not get it unless you\u2019d wanna be dissatisfied. For like $8-9 though I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth trying out and if you like it you like it, but if you don\u2019t you don\u2019t. Now for the size comparison I\u2019d say it is quite big, personally i think it\u2019s worth it so once I run out I will be buying another. Like the size of the lotion is bigger than my hand which says a lot because my hands are quite big. Now if you\u2019re planning on using this to moisturize your body, I\u2019d say it is okay but there is much better lotions out there but it is good to add into your routine if you wanna smell like vanilla. It does leave a nice smooth texture on my skin though and it lasts for a good amount of time; the scent does last indeed. Now for the thickness i\u2019d say it isn\u2019t that light but it isn\u2019t heavy weighted either, honestly feels like the texture of yogurt which is honestly a coincidence considering some people say it does in fact smell like yogurt. Now for the value for money i\u2019d say it is really worth it considering the fact that it is quite big and costs less; definitely get it if you\u2019re looking for an affordable lotion. Anyways, that\u2019s about all, I hope my review did help you I know I would have for sure liked to hear this from someone else before I\u2019d gotten it! Overall, I\u2019m rating it a 3.5/5 which is basically a 7/10!",

            "review_comment": "ANOTHER UPDATE ~ These lotions really got me going through it. After trying all scents I have a solid ranking that can help others.\n1. Fresh & Cozy\n2. Strawberry Dream (Fresh & Cozy and Strawberry Dream are interchangeable but Fresh & Cozy seems more universal and versatile)\n3. Coconut Waters (Coconut Waters was 4th before because Pink Champagne is more exotic smelling and I\u2019m trying to give a more universal rating but it\u2019s definitely more my personality so I had to switch it.)\n4. Pink Champagne\n5. Vanilla Cashmere\n6. Jasmine Peach\n7. Pomegranate Raspberry\n\neos Shea Better Fresh & Cozy Moisture Body Lotion\nMorning light, dewy cassis and sheer musk\nThe fragrance of \u201cFresh & Cozy\u201d is so simple yet anything but underwhelming. When you focus on the scent, it, to me, is the epitome of comfort. I highly appreciate it. This is the best out of the ones I\u2019ve tried for the versatility. It\u2019s not the loudest scent out of the line. It\u2019s also not prettiest or overtly feminine scent in the world. But it\u2019s the prettiest universal \u201cclean\u201d/low key scent I\u2019ve ever smelled. It\u2019s like pretty linens not just linens and that is obviously attributed to the cassis. I don\u2019t have anything as refreshing yet feminine as this. Makes no sense how comforting it smells.\n\neos Shea Better Strawberry Dream Moisture Body Lotion\nsparkling strawberry, pink sugar, and vanilla cream\nI initially was disappointed by this scent because the strawberry note is not as strong as I was expecting and it doesn\u2019t last on the skin but this is the best scent for my body chemistry and i really like the slightly creamy pink sugar smell that remains for hours, even until the next day, on my skin! It makes me feel really cute yet it\u2019s not immature to me! It is BY FAR the longest lasting fragrance out of the ENTIRE line on me and It\u2019s actually my favorite now after prolonged use. I get it now I was just impatient. I wanted to make it #1 but everyone\u2019s taste is different.\n\neos Shea Better Pink Champagne Moisture Body Lotion\npear champagne, ruby pomegranate & plum suede\njuicy, different. pretty. feminine. I had my mom put it on and it reaffirmed my opinion of it. the sillage and projection is much stronger on her. Smells very good and exotic. I haven\u2019t always been into scented lotions so the notes in this are very intriguing to me. It\u2019s just so good! It\u2019s notes are loud and distinct on my skin yet the overall exotic scent doesn\u2019t last as long on me. this definitely can be in 3rd place. but it\u2019s not as versatile for my personality. It\u2019s VERY pretty and unique. It doesn\u2019t stand out on my skin as distinctly or as long as Strawberry Dream. It actually leaves my skin in an hour and what remains is a sheer pear/plum musky smell for an additional hour. Interesting. I don\u2019t like categorizing scents by seasons but it definitely gives off summer vibes. I\u2019m a Autumn/Winter girl.\n\neos Shea Better Coconut Waters Moisture Body Lotion\ncreamy coconut, lush hibiscus and solar musk\nI am most surprised by this lotion as I tried to stay away from coconut scented products because they always smell like pi\u00f1a colada. I don\u2019t want anything tropical. Like I mentioned before I love milky and creamy scents and I was hoping it would smell like coconut milk and for now this is as close as I\u2019ll get. it is more creamy and musky than tropical and it\u2019s overall really pretty. I like it more than Pink Champagne and wear it more. So creamy! The hibiscus in this definitely helps it. I find this to be more interesting than the vanilla cashmere as that one to me just smells like caramel. I also put a baby oil on top of this and i\u2019m telling you it smells so creamy and yummy.\n\neos Shea Better Vanilla Cashmere Moisture Body Lotion\nwhipped vanilla, soft musk and cozy caramel\nI love vanilla, I love cream, I love milk scents. This isn\u2019t bad but I can see how someone sensitive to scented products would smell burnt plastic instead of caramel. It\u2019s more caramel than vanilla. Surprisingly my least favorite. A true vanilla lotion would be the one from The Lotion Company. That one is straight vanilla bean. The caramel isn\u2019t cozy to me and is too sweet. A very gummy burnt (not in a bad way) caramel scent. I like smelling like a snack but it\u2019s a bit too much for me. It actually gives me a headache. There\u2019s nothing soft or cozy about this. I think I find this to smell a bit too juvenile for me. It\u2019s clearly about personal taste. I know many adults who like this. I think teenager every time I smell it. Strawberry Dream has a creaminess mixed into so I can take it a bit more seriously i guess.\n\neos Shea Better Jasmine Peach Moisture Body Lotion\napricot nectar, sparkling jasmine, and vanilla sugar\nI was looking for some thing similar to the Johnson baby lotion in the pink bottle but without the green leafy note. It\u2019s a bit feminine, but not powdery and babyish. You get more jasmine than peach. It\u2019s basically jasmine with a sour undertone. It\u2019s, so far, the least impressive out of the bunch. it\u2019s also a bit screechy/pissy on me sometimes. Fresh & Cozy is stronger and lasts longer than this. The smell goes so fast and it\u2019s not even that noticeable so I\u2019m returning. I keep going nose blind to it. When I do smell it I\u2019m just sure you can find something stronger and less simple at bath and body works and i don\u2019t even shop there. It\u2019s just not that good and I personally like jasmine as a fragrance note in perfumes. My mother likes it. It smells like grandma to me and I usually like scents that lean more sensual and/or mature.\n\neos Shea Better Pomegranate Raspberry Moisture Body Lotion\nluscious pomegranate blended with tart raspberries and lotus blossom\nIt\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s not for my personality. Unlike Jasmine Peach, you can smell this one easily. Not interested in tart scents but thought I\u2019d try anyway. It reminds me of a scent of hand sanitizer I would\u2019ve gotten from bath and body works. It\u2019s an average lotion scent and it\u2019s not bad. Not my choice. if Jasmine Peach Was better I would prefer it over this if I was forced to choose.\n\n~ OLD Update: I raised it a star. I like strawberry dream but when it dries it\u2019s just pink sugar. Not much cream. no strawberry. It\u2019s cute. not that interesting but my nose welcomed the smell a bit more and i won\u2019t return it. i\u2019m not *AS* disappointed. ~\n\nOLD REVIEW ~\nIt\u2019s more sugar and cream and hardly any strawberry. I can\u2019t believe I like Pink Champagne more than Strawberry Dream. It\u2019s not bad but it smells like sugar cookies or biscuits. I was hoping for a strawberry cupcake vibe. There\u2019s no strawberry once rubbed in. You only smell it right out of the bottle. For Pink Champagne I give it 4.5 stars because although I don\u2019t usually like fruity smells, plum is not that common of a fragrance note for me to associate it with anything childish or juvenile. Plum and pear smell quite good. Lol i\u2019m only 23 but i don\u2019t like smelling like Skittles. I really don\u2019t regret buying that one! Especially because I have others in my collection so it\u2019s a good addition. Vanillas, milks, and cream scents are really nice and Strawberry Dream is a basic sugary scent that I\u2019m unimpressed by. Disappointing. It doesn\u2019t smell bad it\u2019s just not as interesting or strong as the other lotions. Even Fresh and Cozy is more unique than this. Good thing is these lotions are the only lotions I feel that don\u2019t leave my skin dry or absorb instantly. It leaves a bit of lubrication behind on the skin and not just a thin \u201cdry\u201d layer of oil. A nice silky finish on the skin. Comfortable and good value.",

Hoo boy, I must be sensitive to scent cause this stuff is strong. My husband could smell it across the room. It's REALLY sweet and has a bit of a chemical smell. I know vanilla scent is always a risk if smelling too sweet, but I was hoping the \"cashmere\" part might add a more mature depth to the smell. It did not.  It very much smells like a child's scent. I smell like I just popped out of an easy bake oven. I'm still giving 4 stars cause it does make my skin very soft, im just not a fan if this scent. Returning liquids is a pain so I'll just finish the bottle, but if I buy again in the future, I'll definitely go with unscented or cozy fresh.",

It's a small step toward sustainability, which is a win in my book.\n\nWarmth: It's reasonably warm for a lightweight sweatshirt. Great for those slightly chilly days when you don't need a heavy coat but still want an extra layer.\n\nCons:\n\nDurability: After a few washes, I noticed some pilling on the fabric. It's not a deal-breaker, but it does make the sweatshirt look a bit worn out sooner than I expected.\n\nSizing: The sizing can be a bit inconsistent. I ordered a medium, which fits perfectly, but a friend ordered the same size, and it was slightly larger on him. So, you might want to double-check the size chart before purchasing.\n\nColor Fading: The color fades slightly after a few washes. It still looks okay, but it's not as vibrant as it was when it first arrived.\n\nOverall, the Hanes Men's EcoSmart sweatshirt is a solid choice if you're looking for an affordable, comfortable, and eco-friendly option. Just be aware of the potential for minor durability issues and color fading. For the price, though, it's hard to beat!",

However, I found that the fabric feels a bit thinner and less substantial than what I'm used to with Fruit of the Loom. While it keeps me warm, it lacks that cozy, heavyweight feel that I really enjoy in a sweatshirt.\n\nOne thing I appreciated about the Hanes sweatshirt is the variety of colors and styles available, so there\u2019s something for everyone. Still, in terms of overall quality and comfort, I would choose Fruit of the Loom any day. If you're looking for a basic sweatshirt that will get the job done, this Hanes option is fine, but for those who prioritize warmth and durability, I recommend going with Fruit of the Loom instead.",

            "review_title": "Several things to be aware of",
            "review_comment": "FOR REFERENCE:  I bought 2 of the sweatshirts in Stonewash Green, sizes Medium and Large.\n\nMy intent was to find something reasonably priced, warm, and comfy to wear - mainly so I could quickly put together a basic, casual, and decent looking outfit that was suitable to wear in public.  I wanted a sweatshirt I could launder at least 15 times before it became too worn out looking to try to wear at a social event.  Even after the appearance degraded, I still wanted the sweatshirt to remain warm, comfy, and in tact so I could wear it while lounging inside my home or during other situations that didn't require me to look quite as put together.\n\nI'm a female, 5'6 tall, about 115 lbs, 32C bra size, 26 inch waist, and 36.5 inch hips. I have slightly broader shoulders and a slightly longer torso than the average female of my size.  I have a slender build.\nI wanted one sweatshirt to fit pretty loose (for layering and comfort) and another to have a trendy oversized looked.\n\nI definitely should have bought larger sizes, and I don't think these sweatshirts will hold up the way I had hoped.\n\nMAIN THOUGHTS:  Overall quality is \"barely okay.\" (I guess it really depends on how you intend to use this sweatshirt and the pricing. You may find the quality to be acceptable... or very disappointing.)  Shrinks a lot after just one wash - almost by a size and a half.  Shrinkage is more drastic in the length of the body and sleeves, but also affects the width.  Overall, does not launder well under \"normal conditions.\"  You may have to be very careful to avoid any heat or abrasiveness to keep this sweatshirt looking its best for as long as possible. (Not worth the effort, IMO.)  Stains show easily on this particular color and are surprisingly difficult to remove.  Possible dye issues.  The large sweatshirt came out with what appears to be bleached/faded spots on the bottom banding. (We don't use bleach or a lot of harsh chemicals in my home due to allergies and skin sensitivity issues. So, I'm not sure how this occured. No other clothing item came out of the laundry with the same problem.)  Already noticed some slight pilling in spots.  Barely noticeable now, but this is only after one laundry session.  Sweatshirts aren't very warm, but they are comfortable (as long as you get the correct size).\n\nIf you choose to buy this sweatshirt, I'd recommend you buy 1-2 sizes larger to account for shrinkage and to allow for layering.  If you only plan to wear a thin tank top underneath, you probably don't need to size up too much.  But if you plan to wear a long sleeve thermal underneath and still want a loose fit, I'd go up 2 sizes.\n\nMORE SPECIFIC DETAILS:  This sweatshirt is between light-weight and mid-weight thickness.  It's more suitable to wear during chilly/cooler days in the Fall or Spring.  It's not enough to keep someone warm during very cold Winter weather without adding several layers underneath and on top.\n\nI wore both sweatshirts twice before washing them.  Once with only a tank top underneath, and once with a thin long sleeve thermal underneath.  Then I machine washed them in semi-warm water and dried them on medium heat (being careful not to leave them in the dryer more than necessary).\n\nBEFORE LAUNDERING:  Both sweatshirts felt slightly rough (nothing really bothersome or too noticeable) and disappointingly thin.  The color was as expected - a lovely muted, pale green.  One sweatshirt arrived with excess threads hanging from the bottom.  But I was able to safely cut them off without risk of anything unraveling.  I liked the way both tops fit and draped.  The sizes were as I hoped they would be.  I accidentally spilled a cold, milky coffee drink on the smaller sweatshirt.  I treated it with a pre-wash stain remover.  Then threw both sweatshirts in the washer with a pair of jeans and no-lint sports towel (all similar colors as the sweatshirts).\n\nAFTER LAUNDERING:  Both tops became softer and slightly fluffier after washing.  This made them feel a bit thicker and warmer.  Both were noticably smaller, though.  The large top now fits similar to the way the medium used to fit.  Except it's a tad bit shorter. Both tops no longer drape the way they did before I washed them.  It's not a huge issue for me, though.  The banding on both tops also shrank a bit.  I no longer like the way the medium fits me.  Prior to washing, the end of the sleeves reached halfway down my fingers.  The sleeve cuffs were loose enough that I could have them drape that way, but just snug enough that I could pull them back around my wrists.  Now the wrist cuffs sit snuggly around my wrists.  When I reach for items above my head, the sleeves pull back a bit, exposing more of my wrists... and the waist hem rides up so that I have to yank it down when I drop my arms back down to my sides.  (That's how badly the top shrank in length after just one wash!)  The brown color from where I spilled my coffee on the medium top was gone, but there's still a visible stain.  It just looks a couple shades darker than the sweatshirt color... like I spilled water on myself and it's starting to dry a bit.  (I'm going to try a different stain remover and wash it again.  Hopefully it works, otherwise this top will permanently look dirty.)  As I already mentioned, the larger top had some pale pumkin-yellow spots on the lower banding - similar to what bleach spots would look like.  I'm okay with the fit of the larger size sweatshirt even after it shrank.  So, it's a shame that the color bled the way it did.\n\nOverall, I'm disappointed with my purchases.  These are already going to be dedicated lounging and housework shirts.  They are a bit warmer and very soft inside, which is nice.  And nothing has unraveled, so it seems the stitching is good.  I don't think these would be great for screen-printing, simply because of the amount of shrinkage and the fact that they're already showing signs of pilling in areas that don't get much friction.\n\nHope this info helps. If anything, these aren't bad sweatshirts to have on hand to adapt to temperature fluctuations.  They're stretchy, so they're easy to quickly throw on as an extra layer and take off as needed.  Just be mindful they leave some lint behind on 100% cotton shirts.  The lint problem will probably diminish after a few washes, though.",

Here\u2019s what I think:\n\nPros:\n \u2022 Soft and Cozy: The fabric is soft and comfortable, providing just the right amount of warmth for cooler days. It\u2019s cozy without being too thick or heavy, making it perfect for layering.\n \u2022 Casual Style: The classic crewneck design is simple but stylish, easy to pair with jeans, leggings, or shorts.

There\u2019s no pilling or shrinkage, which is a plus for long-term wear.\n \u2022 Breathable: Despite being warm, the fabric is breathable enough to keep you comfortable during mild weather without overheating.\n \u2022 Affordable: It\u2019s a great value for the price, providing both quality and comfort without breaking the bank.\n\nCons:\n \u2022 Basic Design: While the simplicity is part of the appeal, some may find the design too plain or lacking in extra details like a pocket or unique stitching.\n \u2022 Fit Can Vary: Depending on the brand, the fit might be a little loose or tight, so it\u2019s important to check sizing carefully.\n\nOverall: The pullover crewneck sweatshirt is a must-have for anyone looking for an easy, comfortable wardrobe staple. It\u2019s cozy, durable, and versatile enough to wear on a daily basis, making it a great addition to any casual wardrobe.",

Well yeah but..here are a couple of points to be careful about. First, the fabric quality while good for both of the styles and colors I bought vary from style to style. My first purchase was a two pack of the blue patterned shirts and they were definitely comfy so I bought two other shirts in non-patterned colors. The fabric was very different from the two pack. Comfortable yes but not nearly as soft. Second, the sizes were also very different. I'm normally an XXL in T's but the patterned shirts were huge on me. I then ordered XL's for the second order and they were way too small. There's just a wide difference in both fabric and size that seems to depend on patterned versus solid. I know that the company that owns Comfort Colors has a separate brand but in the Wire Cutter review they made a statement that the CC's were far more comfortable than their cousins. I don't know if they're mixing shirts between companies but felt that while I liked both shirts the differences and variations were concerning.",

I ordered a couple more pairs about 6 months ago. Not the same. Tag says made in Honduras.  No extra room in the back area. Extra room in the front area. They look and feel ridiculous.  I come back to order more today -  it says made in El Salvador on the Amazon page!!  so I think, maybe they just sent the wrong ones. Nope!!  The tag say made in Honduras !  They are the same wrong ones again. This time I\u2019m send these back and just going to the store to see if I can find correct ones. Ridiculous!  Totally defeats the purpose of of reading the descriptions for the product.  So disappointed. These pants are not good if you are a women and have any kind of shape in your rear.

            "review_comment": "I loved these pants when I got them, and I got four pairs of black.  Until I put them in my washing machine, all four of them inside out, so that the lint could wash out from the inside.  (inexpensive sweat pants have this lint that falls off)  The first problem was that the pants were so heavy when soaked up with water, that the washing machine took twenty minutes to spin instead of four: they were just clunking around heavy in the circle and not rinsing properly.  Then I had one pair of black that I washed with some other clothes, and everything took on the black color -- my white cotton socks all turned grey.  This was very sad because I really really liked these pants in every way: soft enough to sleep in, stylish enough to wear outside to the store, or anywhere.  Oh well.  So I returned them, and ordered some light Khaki Heather ones, two pairs medium, but they were never shipped, and a note on my phone said they could not be shipped because they don't take gift cards.  But the only size they have which ship quickly (not the 7 days of the other ones) were sized large and small, which I went ahead and ordered anyway: I will see if I can wear them, if not I will have to return them.  I'm really waiting for the medium ones, in beige heather, and repeated the order, and am waiting to see if they will ship.  The medium size ships a week later; the other sizes seem to be from a different place and ship overnight like they are supposed too.\nUpdate:  I easily got a refund for all the black ones I returned, and my second order of Khaki Heather LARGE ones arrived: (I returned the SMALL as they were child-sized) I laundered them and the light color didn't ruin anything in the wash.  They are soft and comfortable, so nice, so I ordered 4 more of the Khaki Heather Large.  I love the light color.  They are long, but the elastic bottoms prevent the pants for sliding down and touching the floor.  The elastic bottoms are very gentle, you don't feel them at all.  These are the most comfortable sweats I have ever had, they are good to wear inside and out for errands, which I can not say about my other sweats.  I will order even more pairs. They do not shrink in the wash (maybe a tad only, but that's good), and as the color is Khaki Heather, the color does not ruin everything in the wash.  The black ones are the best, but be forewarned that you must launder them only with all other completely black clothes or towels.  If they are not good at first, they are very easy to return, and then order a size up or down.",

            "review_comment": "So, a few years ago I purchased a new set of Fruit of the Loom sweatpants and I was soooo disappointed.\n\nI order Men\u2019s Large because I want a very roomy fit and pockets.  Boy oh boy was I disappointed!  This was a few years ago but here\u2019s a quick recap.  I ordered three pairs of Men\u2019s Large and one pair fit like it was supposed to, one pair was too fitted in the tush area (I order big because I want baggy) and the third pair had such a short crotch that I could only wear them as hip huggers which makes them very uncomfortable.  I hesitated to wear them to the gym for fear of bending over and someone mistaking me for a plumber (if you know what I mean \ud83d\ude0a!) . . .  Anyway, I don\u2019t put my clothes thru the dryer (since my dryer broke) and one pair even split at the side seam just above the pocket.  So, I swore I would never buy FOTL sweatpants again.\n\nFast forward a few years later and guess what I did?  Yup \u2013 I bought three new pair and much to my surprise, these are all sized the same, are roomy & comfortable and most importantly, have adequate crotch length.  Maybe I just had a bad batch last time but it was ridiculous.  I\u2019m satisfied with this new batch but my one observation is the tush area isn\u2019t as generously proportioned as it used to be but the sweatpants are very comfortable nonetheless.  They have a drawstring waist so there is plenty of girth, wash up beautifully and have elastic at the ankle so no riding up the leg.  They are also super soft.\n\nWould I buy them again, yes!  But I plan to keep these for a few more years if they are as durable as their predecessors.",

            "review_comment": "I have been using these for 6 years, and they last a good 3 years each set (if not longer).  The water beads right off your windshield.  These are far superior to even the most expensive windshield wipers you can buy.  \"The technology that cause the water to bead\" is fantastic and last for the life of the rubber on the windshield wiper.  I want to be clear.  It is not the \"beading of water on the window\"  that ultimately fails BUT the rubber of the windshield wiper (like all others) that eventually wears out.  The \"water beading\" feature lasts as long as the wiper itself lasts.  This \"water beading\" technology is what makes these windshield wipers standout from the competition.  They are also priced for a good value at about $19 a piece compared to $59 to $75 for a set for the supposedly best or most high-end priced ones.  My only complaint which is NOT with Rain-X but with Mercedes, is that Mercedes unnecessarily makes their windshield wiper connection more complex than it should be.  Instead of simple, they believe in complicated for everything.  It took me 20 minutes per wiper, cursing like a sailor to get these windshield wipers on the Mercedes arms / connectors.  The Mercedes's cars have an unnecessary retaining rod that interferes with the Rain-X attachment making it difficult to get them on.  Know that if you work with it long enough, you can get them on correctly without any modifications.  It is just a matter of angling the wipers just right to get them on correctly.  However, it is well worth it as these windshield wipers are far, far superior to the best competitors brand at likely half the price.  I rate A++.",

            "review_comment": "Ok, this was the BIGGEST pain. I 100% got the right size for my 2020 Honda Accord, 26\" for the left, 16\" for the right. I am a capable, intelligent, adult woman. I have installed my fair share of windsheild wipers in my 45 years, in the rain, in the dark, at the gas station, in front of the auto parts store,  on the side of the road, in the rain, without a flashlight.\nI purchased these, left and right to replace my set that was very far gone, due to summertime and sap.\nSo, last evening I attempted to install them, ahead of today's rain storm. I followed the directions, not great directions, but I understood them. The tab would NOT click closed. I could NOT have pushed harder without breaking them and my fingers hurt. So, It was clear to me that the J hook need to be seated further inside the housing...\nSo ok. I tried and TRIED to seat the J hook further into the blade housing. There was NO budging. I tried multiple times on BOTH sides. I  put enough pressure and force into it that I was afraid I was going to bend or break the metal arm, the part attached to my car. I actually gave up, a first for me. I figured I would revisit the issue in the morning with fresh eyes and fingers. But the rain was coming, and today was an important day, so it HAD to get done. It's just wiper blades, for heavens sake. I didn't doubt that I could do it. BUT, I tried again, and AGAIN. I called my ex for advice. I watched videos. I double checked that I had the right size. Well, I ended up having to borrow a friend's car to take my kid to school. I came back home, I tried AGAIN, nope.\nI had to cancel on a dear friend who desperately need my support in court. THIS is what I am most upset about.\nSo, I read Amazon reviews looking for insight, I watched YouTube videos, Rain X website videos. I desperately tried EVERYTHING so I could show up for my friend. FINALLY, (but way too late to help my friend) I found a post on reddit from some wonderful man who said if the j hooks don't fit down far enough to snap the closure shut, and no amount of force is pushing it down, you have to remove the black outer casing to expose the three holes on the side and use a small screwdriver to force the J hook far enough in to allow the tab to snap shut. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So, yeah I got to work. Well, it worked, thank the Lord above.\nBut, by this time it's already 5pm, court is over and its dark, damp and cold... THEN I found out it's a bad idea to run Rain X wipers over dirty glass. Its due to rain in an hour! My kid has school tomorrow and I have to go to work, turns out, windsheild wipers are IMPORTANT. Just saying. So....Great. AND you have to run them at medium speed for 2 to 3 minutes on DRY, CLEAN glass at the moment of installation. Wonderful. I have a pine tree above my driveway that shares lots of its sap with me. So, I wash the windsheild with soap and water, rince, dry, use a razor blade for the drops of sap, wipe away any traces of sap with rubbing alcohol, final rinse, and dry with a microfiber cloth.\nOk, I remove the yellow protective case around the blades, lower them, lovingly, onto my sparkling clean and dry windsheild, turn the car on, run the wipers on the dry windsheild at medium speed for 3 minutes, then add the final splash of water. I got back in the car to check out my handiwork, turn the wipers on and WITH EVERY SWIPE OF THE BLADES there is a haze that lasts for a couple seconds. Not a problem, IF you're just swiping away a little water or using low speed. However, if you are using high speed wipers, the temporary haze doesn't go away fast enough before the next swipe. WONDERFUL, because yes, I went through all that so that I could drive around in a rainstorm with a windsheild I CANT SEE OUT OF.\nI am so very displeased, I never thought that, in my life, I would have such an issue and have so many problems because of WINDSHIELD WIPER BLADES. This is ridiculous, writing this review is ridiculous, and probably a fat waste of my time, but honestly, I'm MAD enough that I don't care. WHAT is the deal with over complicated wiper blades? WHY is there an outer shell, an inner blue piece, and so many different ways to configure it, but no actual way to USE it without finding a person on Reddit to tell you how??? I 100% did everything right. I even had my friend try to put the wipers on, he couldn't do it either.\nI'll give two stars, instead of one, for this reason: I should have bought new blades before winter and before it was totally necessary. I'm willing to take responsibility for that. I also should have done more research, you know, kinda like a \"stupid\" tax that I have to pay, if I wasn't busy with kids, and career, and LIFE. I guess I should have found the time to research these blades so that I WOULDN'T have bought them.\nThe dirty windsheild, the sap.. ok thats MY problem. I should have done more research into Rain X. The fact of the matter is, I just wanted wiper blades to wipe the water away. I assumed a name brand set was a good idea, but I didn't put much thought into what Rain X was. My fault. I didn't know that the blades have a coating of Rain X that makes a mess, another \"stupid\" tax. And that it has to be properly prepped (not that proper preparation did me the slightest bit of good) I dont know... did I miss a step? I just thought it was a brand. My bad.\nIn the past, depending on the circumstances of my wiper needs, I always either just bought Bosch, or a store brand and just put them on the stinking car!\nNonsense. Never again. Overly complicated, difficult and very disappointing results, once these blades are either worn out, or prove to be a hazard due to not being able to SEE, I am anticipating having to strip the product off of my windsheild with some chemical. I'll probably find help for that issue on Reddit.\nI just want to say that once I had finally found someone to tell me how to get enough leverage to forcibly shove the j hook in the wipers far enough to lock them in place, (without damaging my car)  and gathered all my tools, it took me 40 minutes, start to finish to install and prep the windsheild with wholly disappointing results. I will reiterate here that I am a very capable woman, installing wiper blades is way below my pay grade. I'm obviously irritated. And NOW, I will be even MORE irritated tomorrow, when I drive to work, in a rainstorm, and can't see out of my windsheild. TOTAL Garbage.",

Run them across ice or peel them off a windshield when they're frozen to it and they're all going to tear about the same. Unless you go up to the crazy expensive ones there's no reason to spend a ton of money on these things. It's just too bad so many of them are sold as singles now but I guess it's because there are so many different options that you might end up with a two-pack where only one fits.

It has a strong, pleasant fragrance that effectively eliminates any unpleasant odors in the car, but it\u2019s not overpowering at all. It creates a nice, refreshing atmosphere without being overwhelming, which can sometimes be the case with other products.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this air freshener to anyone looking to freshen up their vehicle.

The wooden design is unique and looks great hanging in my car, adding a touch of style that most air fresheners don\u2019t offer. It\u2019s a nice change from the typical bulky, plastic air fresheners.\n\nThe amber scent is warm and pleasant\u2014not overpowering, but just enough to make the car smell fresh without being overwhelming. It\u2019s a subtle, sophisticated fragrance that doesn\u2019t feel artificial or overly sweet like some other air fresheners.\n\nThe installation was incredibly easy, and I like that it's made of wood, which adds an eco-friendly touch. After a couple of weeks, the scent is still noticeable, though it has faded a bit faster than I expected. I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the scent lasted longer, but it\u2019s still a solid product.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a stylish, subtle air freshener that adds a nice scent without taking over the whole car, this is a great choice. I\u2019ll likely try other scents from Drift in the future.\n\nPros:\n\nStylish wooden design\nPleasant amber scent\nEasy to install\nCons:\n\nScent could last longer\nOverall, a great addition to my car!",

One for the driver and passenger side.\n\nI installed them on Saturday, the scent was very strong, I see other reviews of people saying just how powerful the scent is and it is true, it's a powerful scent, however, it is right in front of your face as you drive and with the AC on or Heat on will further blow it into your face.\n\nNow, as I said, I installed it on Saturday and by Monday the smell was so faint that I forgot that I had installed them.\n\nComes Tuesday, zero scent, I was so disappointed. I questioned myself to see if I had done something wrong, and I followed the instructions that I came with them and I also watched videos on them.\n\nNow, I am not sure if it starts off strong and then just supposed to lightly scent your vehicle, because I don't even smell it when I open the door and get in after the door has been closed all night.\n\nMaybe I received bad ones? But what are the chances of receiving two bad ones?\n\nEven before writing this review I went to my car to see if I was able to smell anything and it was so little that it didn't make sense at all.\n\nI think they have a great product here, it looks beautiful within the car, but they need to do more quality checks on this product.\n\nNow, they get you by saying that it can last up to 30 days ... But how? What makes it last 30 days?\nWhat would make it not smell after 48 hours?",

Everything you need is in the kit except masking tape, which I would highly recommend you use to tape off the perimeter of your light so you don\u2019t get any of the coating on your car paint or accidentally hit it with the sand paper.\n\nYou first use the oxidizer remover, wipe and clean that off, then you go to the 1000 and 2000 grit sanding discs. Get a good spray bottle with nice clean water, keep the headlight wet while you\u2019re sanding it because basically what you\u2019re doing is wet sanding the surface. You can actually feel the sandpaper, engaging the scratches, and when you finally have a nice smooth, feel to it, spray it down and wipe it off and clean it with a microfiber cloth. Then apply the coating. When you apply the coating, it is literally a miracle. How perfect and clean and clear the lens becomes. It looks brand freaking new!\n\nI literally was walking around the garage looking at it saying \u201cdamn that looks good\u201c, damn that looks good! You will not be disappointed.

            "review_comment": "This product works so well, the amount of effort and time you spend on it is far exceeded by the results, it's almost like magic. Look at my before and after pictures and see for yourself.\n\nThe headlights I used this on were oxidized, I normally use headlight polish on it every month or so to clear it up but it takes a lot of effort, the results aren't amazing and it only lasts a month. The before pictures show the extent of it after a complete wash and wipe down with isopropyl alcohol. The instructions were clear, though I did notice one typo, it mentions to use a red sanding pad followed by gray, but my kit came with red and green, I just assumed green for gray and it was fine.\n\nObviously the amount of time and effort you spend will depend on the size of your headlight and how intricate it is, headlights with intricate complex shapes and reliefs popping out will be annoying, you'll have to use the sandpaper by itself without the foam grip and fold it and spend a lot of time on edges and corners. In addition to the instructions I highly recommend you mask off the entire surrounding area with painter's tape, make sure you fold the painter's tape over and into the gap between the headlight and the bumper or fender.\n\nThe nail biting part is at the end when you're applying the clear coat, you obviously don't want to mess it up, you're undoubtedly going to notice you missed a tiny spot, despite the directions saying not to go over it in multiple passes, I did it anyway and it turned out fine, you just want to do it quickly before it has time to set. The clear coat is legit sorcery, it self levels, I even saw a few tiny air bubbles and those all disappeared, after an hour it was dry and the finish not only looked 100% clear, it was completely free of defects and texturing, it literally (and I can't emphasize this enough) looked like a brand new headlight. I would expect a clear coat applied with a small gauze pad to be uneven, have visible strokes in it (like brush strokes), instead it's completely level with no marks and has no texture whatsoever, when I rub my fingers over it the surface feels shiny, reflective, slippery, like a new headlight. The result was so good I kept staring at it for over ten minutes at all angles, I was in awe.\n\nTime will tell how long it will last, if it even lasts a year I'll be happy. From now on I'm never polishing headlights again, I wax them with a non-abrasive wax to keep them clean but once they (eventually) oxidize to the point of cloudiness, it's time for this kit.\n\nThe pictures show driver's side \"before\" (I didn't take a picture of passenger side \"before\" but it looked the same), then an after shot for both driver and passenger side.\n\nSome things about the before shot:\n1. To some this may look like light oxidation because you can still somewhat see through it, that oxidation is actually lighter than it normally would be, because it hasn't been that long since I last polished it with headlight polish. Had I left it for a few more months it would have become totally opaque.\n2. If you're wondering on the before shot why there's a sharp line/termination toward the top where it becomes completely clear, that's where the hood sits and blocks the UV from the sunlight, think of it like a farmer's tan.",

The second step is sanding off all the stuff that the step one wipes didn't remove. The 3rd step is where the magic happens. If you watch the video from the maker of the wipes you will think it is fake but it is not!!!! It made my head light lenses look just as good as new. Plus, when I went to work the next morning (2:30 am) the beam from the headlights were so clear and crisp. I love this product!!!! I just applied it 3 weeks ago so I can't tell you if it will last the life of the vehicle like they claim. But even if it lasts 6 months, it is so cheap and easy to do, it's worth it. I 100% recommend using this product.",

            "review_comment": "I needed to restore 11yr old headlights to pass safety inspection. I did the home remedy of baking soda & WD40. Not good enough. Then I tried 2 different meguiar products - good enough to pass inspection but not great. Then I tried THIS product & wish I'd only done this one! Crystal clear headlights.\n\nPros:\n-  Easy to follow instructions.\n-  Tidy. Each part is \"use & toss\" so you don't have to store remaining product.\n-  It comes with everything except water (spray bottle or a cup of water) and a couple clean rags.\n-  The sandpaper part is easy to do, even for a non-DIY person.\n-  Even if you mess up, it's not that bad.\n-  You really can get this done in 20 minutes.\n\nCons\n-  You shouldn't drive your car for at least 60 minutes after so the stuff can dry.\n(This probably should have be true on the other products, but I don't remember reading that.)\n\nI think what makes this kit perform better are the multiple cleaning wipes & the right sandpaper. And the quality of the instructions.\n\nThe benefit of using 3 different kits & a home remedy means I can confirm I didn't have to sacrifice quality for ease of use. This stuff is good.\n\nAnyways, I realize I'm adding to the 47K great reviews which probably isn't necessary. But I'm just a regular person trying a DIY solution to a problem and it worked great!",

            "review_comment": "This is my second time using this product. It lasted about three years the last time I did it. Same car,  (2013) same lights. If you have never done this, let me clue you out on what you should expect.\nStep one is pretty easy, you apply the chemical with the included pad over your lights to remove the surface level oxidation. It\u2019s part of the surface prep, and will not impress you in terms of the results. But it\u2019s only step one.\nStep two, prepare to feel like you are destroying your lights. Using a spray bottle with water and the provided sandpaper, you will begin to sand the surface of your lights. They are not going to become clear, they are going to look like you\u2019ve sanded them, to the point of oblivion. White, cloudy, destroyed, this is how they\u2019re going to look in step two. The purpose is to get them smooth, not clear. A lot of goo is going to come off of your lights during this phase, you might be sanding for 20 or 30 minutes to get them ready. But eventually, you will reach a consistent level of smoothness. The sandpaper is a very light grit, so you will not be destroying your lights, it\u2019s just going to look like you are :-).\nStep three, you might want to film this because it\u2019s very satisfying. Once everything is clean and dry, you\u2019re going to apply the step three application with one wipe in an overlapping manner.\nThe cloudiness will immediately disappear, and while you will think this is clear only because it is still wet\u2014 prepare to be amazed.\nIn about 15 seconds, your lights are completely restored, and now they just need to dry. The clarity will not go away, they will still look wet in an hour or weeks from now. All of the work in steps one and two are required to achieve the results in step three, you really need to follow the directions to get amazing results.\nI recommend applying some painters tape around your lights so the sandpaper does not scratch your paint while you are moving it around. I also recommend using a lot of water while sanding, so you can see your progress easier. It\u2019s a messy prep process so you might want to have some paper towels on hand.\nThe first time I did this process, it took me over an hour, because I had never done it before. This last time it took about 35 minutes for both lights.\nMy results, while  impressive, are not permanent. Lights wear out, so I would not expect this to be a one time project. Like I said, this was my second time on this car, but three years is excellent resilience.\n\nOnce you notice cloudy headlights, You can\u2019t unsee them. They make a car look so old, and are bad for nighttime driving. Conversely, when you apply this product, your headlights are going to look like you just bought them, your entire car looks newer, just from clearing  the headlights. The whole product is cheaper than a car wash, but dramatically improves your vehicles appearance, and improves safety for nighttime driving as well.\n\nI recommend for any vehicle, or as a gift for friends or family because it\u2019s a nice project that most people would enjoy doing.\n\nSorry I didn\u2019t take a before picture, but the after image speaks for itself. Clear lights like new!\n\nThis project was very satisfying, Positive vibes :-)",

            "review_comment": "I purchased this headlight restoration kit as my last of multiple attempts at fixing the horrible situation with both headlights on my 2015 Chevy Traverse LTZ, which is supposed to be the top trim for this model. Every car like this one I see in the street has this exact same problem: yellow, crusty, glazed headlights that are hard to ignore and just make the whole car look awful. I've tried toothpaste, bug repellent, buffing, none of it lasted more than a few hours.\n\nSo I got this kit and took multiple before-pictures because I've been long waiting for this moment. The reviews showed dozens of miracle restoration to headlights in worse condition.\n\nInstructions are straightforward, though I misread the instructions and repeated the steps by sanding with the first pads again, instead of using the second ones, so I ended up sanding twice as long. Because of that, I did the same and double-sanded with the second set of pads.\n\nMy husband came in for moral support because I was really nervous about ruining my lights. He reassured me that it would all work out. It did!\n\nThe instructions state that the entire headlights should be cloudy (not clear) after sanding is completed. That was not the case for me; even after sanding twice as long across the entire surface, the plastic that had no sun damage was still intact and clear after rinsing. So I moved on to the next step.\n\nThe damage is mostly along the \u201ceyelids\u201d so I spent a little extra time in the damaged areas which were rough, until they felt smooth.\n\nAfter drying them with a clean towel, I waited an hour before applying the ceramic clear coating. I used only 1 pad for both headlights; it was very wet and soaked in liquid. The instructions said to use 1 pad for each headlight, but also stated that less is better and to not leave the surface soaked.\n\nThe passenger headlight had condensation from driving over every single puddles in heavy rain to entertain my kids in the backseat (not doing that again), so it looks worse in the Before pictures. It's all gone in the After pictures, which are taken a week after restoration. The winner is the driver side.\n\nOverall, this product has far exceeded my expectations.",

            "review_comment": "I've had a Slime Home Air Station (120 volt only) for many years, but the hose recently failed and couldn't be repaired, so it was time to find a replacement. This piece meets the need. It seems well-made and comes with a useful User Manual. However, it IS quite different from what I had before.\n\nFirst off, it's 12 volt only, via a standard auto 12V  socket. The User Manual said to start the car's engine while using it, so I'm guessing it draws a fair amount of current and might flatten your battery with prolonged use. The inflator hose is also much shorter than what I was used to, but still long enough to reach the valve-stem at the 12 o'clock position while the compressor remains on the ground. It's a bonus that it stays put when it's running and doesn't skate across the surface, as my old unit did.\n\nThe built-in digital pressure gauge is easy to read, but reads about 2.5 PSI over actual pressure as checked by a separate calibrated  pressure gauge. Actual 35 PSI reads 37.5 PSI on this unit. Not really a big deal. If you can make change, you can do the math.\n\nThe best feature is the Auto-stop at a preset pressure. My old unit did not have this, so I had to stare at the gauge for several minutes as the needle slowly crept up the dial. On this one, just set the desired pressure and start the compressor. The digital pressure gauge shows inflation progress 0.5 PSI at a time. When it hits the preset setting, it shuts off within a few seconds. My car has 235/55ZR20 tires and this unit will raise the pressure from 32 PSI to 38 PSI in about 3 minutes; not as fast as having a tank-type 120 volt 150 PSI compressor, but certainly acceptable for an occasional-use compact 12 volt unit. I paid less than $30 for this one with next day delivery, so I think qualifies as a great value. Highly recommended.",

The only (slight) cons are: it only has a lighter plug, no wall plug, and you have to be quick when you remove the air hose. Otherwise you\u2019ll seep air out of your tire quick.

            "review_comment": "I recently purchased this small compressor, and overall, I\u2019m quite satisfied with its performance. It\u2019s lightweight, compact, and very easy to use. The long cord is a big plus, allowing me to connect it easily and move around my Jeep. The pressure indicator seems accurate, which is a critical feature when inflating tires.\n\nPros:\n\nLightweight and compact design makes it easy to store and handle.\n\nLong cord provides excellent reach, especially for larger vehicles like a Jeep.\n\nAccurate pressure indicator for reliable readings.\n\nCons:\n\nThe connector occasionally slips out of the cigarette lighter socket during use, which can be a bit annoying.\n\nAfter about 10 minutes of use, the connector and hose become quite hot, which might raise durability concerns with prolonged operation.\n\nReal-world performance:\nI tested the compressor on my Jeep's 225/65R17 tires, inflating them from 19 PSI to 35 PSI. Each tire took about 4\u20135 minutes to inflate. After an off-road trip, it took approximately 20 minutes to restore all four tires to road-ready pressure. While this isn't lightning-fast, it\u2019s efficient enough for the occasional off-road enthusiast.\n\nOverall:\nThis compressor is a solid choice for light to moderate use, especially for off-roaders or anyone needing a portable option. A few minor issues aside, it gets the job done reliably.",

Decided right then that it was time to get one of these. This came same day. It's great! Easy to use and way faster than I expected it to be. My tire was down to 19 and it got it up to 32.5 in less than 3 minutes. I had expected it to take maybe 3x that long. The cord is long enough to reach all my tires (I went ahead and did all 4 because I could). It's great to have the peace of mind knowing I have my own air station. I'm buying one for the other vehicle and they'll just stay in the trunk. And I bet in the spring it will work for my wheelbarrow tires too.

            "review_comment": "I purchased my first small portable car tire inflator over 50 years ago and believe it or not it still works only problem is all the rubber hoses have rotted. I also have three others that are still close to the same age and they too still work. I have to attribute that to all of the 4 inflators were made in the USA. However, they did have one flaw and that is they were very slow to bump up a large tire that was totally unflated\n\nWhen I saw the Black Friday sale on these compressors and all the positive reviews as decided to purchase one for my wife's Toyota Sequoia. Also decided that it would be best if she learned how to use the little compressor before a real need arised. Since our weather recently changed and it's gotten cooler all the tires were reading low so she went around bringing the pressure up on all four tires from 3 to 8 pounds. We were both surprised how quickly the little compressor topped the tires off and shut off at the set air pressure. Just to be sure I check the pressure with a gauge and they were right on.\n\nThe electrical cord with a cigarette lighter adapter was completely adequate to reach all four tires using the outlet on the dash. The Sequoia has other outlets but I wanted to see if the the one would take care of all four tires and it did. The inflator is small and light and took up very little storage space in the rear compartment under the deck for items such as this.\n\nPresently we are completely pleased with the purchase, in fact I purchased two more for Christmas gifts. My only concern is the longevity of this Chinese made product. Quite frankly it appears that obsolescence comes quickly to most of the goods that are coming out of China. This concerns me greatly when I give a gift to be used in an emergency that by the time the emergency happens it may be of no use.",

This happened to me early this year too, so I had purchased a jump starter that was a huge lifesaver for me.  I jump start the car, only to find my tires had also gotten very low with the cold temperatures.  This also happened to me on Christmas Eve last year when I lived further north.  At that time I had to get towed, which wasn't the best time for it to happen, and also pretty costly.  I hopped on here and looked for something I could use to inflate my tires that would be as effective and handy as my jump starter, landing on this little beauty.  Yes, I had to wait a couple of days for delivery, but thankfully as I am semi-retired, and work from home, I didn't have to be anywhere urgently.\nI also purchased the DC adapter as I thought it would be better than draining my car battery as we have low temps forecast again.  I hooked it up and away we went.  All four tires inflated to their correct level and I was good to go!  For such a small, inexpensive, piece of equipment, I was very pleased.  I would definitely recommend getting this (as well as a jump starter) for those times they are needed.\nI had previously purchased what I hoped would be an effective, small, handy dandy tool (Norshire) which cost 3x+ as much, but proved to be quite useless as it died (burnt out) after a couple of uses.",

            "review_comment": "I've been an avid detailer for 30 years.  And I do love the chemicals aspect of it.  I've tried many products, and the vast majority of them aren't very good.  Mind you, I was starting out detailing back in the 80's, when you had a VERY limited amount of products to rely on (And yes, I remember the very first days of Armor-All when it would CRACK your dash.. Those days are, of course, long gone.\nBut I have been a big fan of Chemical Guy's products, and have written many reviews on here about their other products.\nThis Total Interior, I have to say, has met or exceeded my expectations.\n\nTip and note:  Always wear nitrile type gloves whenever using any chemicals for detailing, repair, etc  A garage isn't complete without nitrile gloves and an air compressor..  Enough on that.\n\nFirst off, they say you can use it on glass, and this would replace a lot of other cleaners and protectants, I'm not sure I would use anything to clean glass other than Invisible Glass.  I've tried them all, and to me, Invisible Glass is my go-to and ONLY glass cleaner.\n\nSecondly, this DOES have a UV protectant in it, which of course, led me to purchase this.  I've said on here before that if you are going to take the time to detail, and make the effort, you should not waste your time with products (Especially interior products) that don't protect the interior from UV damage.. The sun is a killer on leather and plastic.. (And paint, over time).. So if you're going to use any products on your interior make sure they have UV protectants.\n\nThirdly, they say you can use this on Leather.  I for one, after working with it, probably wouldn't use it on my leather, I prefer some other products for that, and yes, don't bother using ANY leather treatment unless it has a UV protectant in it, or at least follow it up with something that DOES have a UV protectant.  I personally wouldn't use this on my leather.  I would use Chemical Guys' Sprayable Leather Cleaner and Conditioner (no UV protectant), and then follow it with Klasse Interior as the Klasse has a UV protectant.  The Klasse is also a water based formula (The original was oil based) and it also helps to tighten the leather a bit too.. Those two in combination make a nice look.\n\nWhat's nice about this Total Interior Cleaner Protectant (TICP) is the way it goes on.  You want to use a fairly deep piled Microfiber cloth to apply it.  Pre wet the cloth with distilled water in a spray bottle.\nSpray the TICP generously on the interior doors and plastics.  It works especially well cleaning off your armrests and control modules for windows, door locks.  I would generously spray it on the door panels and work it in, but I would not spray it directly on my speaker grills or into the control buttons, you want to work around that. For those areas, after you do the general door panels, or interior, and then come back and spray on your towel, and then hit the specific areas.\n\nFor the front dash, and the LCD screen, I sprayed onto my pre moistened towel, worked it in nicely, then I quickly grabbed another microfiber towel that didn't have a \"pile\" on it.  Almost like those microfiber dishtowels.  The reason why is when you go for that quick buff (And just a quick buff, that's all you need) you can and will create some static.. And when you create that static you'll break off peach fuzz off a piled microfiber cloth and it may stick due to the static.  So use a microfiber towel with no pile on it and quickly buff it, you don't need much, this product is \"hot\" and dries fairly quickly, a couple swipes, that's it.\n\nI did get the baby oil scent, and it's reminiscent of that, but not too strong or overdone.  A nice fragrance.  It comes in a couple other scents.\n\nThe final look is very nice, it's not a shine or a heavy sheen, it's in between the OEM flat look (When you first purchase a new car) and a light satin.  Just enough sheen to spruce up the interior, but not like a basted turkey that looks greasy or oily.  Just right.",

I recently purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my parents because they saw how much I loved mine.\n\nInstallation:\nThe installation instructions were very clear and easy to use. I was able to set it up by myself within about 30 minutes. Once charged, the battery lasts a very long time when using the suggested default settings for motion detection and video. I haven\u2019t had to recharge it since last May 2024. It is incredibly easy to remove the battery from the device to charge.\n\nMotion detection, Video, and Audio:\nThe motion detection sensitivity can be adjusted based on how little or many alerts you receive. You also have the ability to use motion schedules to avoid getting alerts at certain times and days. The video quality is fantastic! I get alerts instantly when someone is approaching the front door. I love that I can login on the app and see who is approaching and speak to them, if needed.\n\nRing app:\nThe app is very user-friendly. I love that I can have more than 1 device connected to it. The app allows you to review videos, adjust motion settings and alerts, and provides posts from neighbors. The ring plan subscription is relatively cheap as well, at only 49.99 per year!\n\nGet the peace of mind you deserve and purchase this product!",

There is a tutorial for this on the app as well.\nCharging takes about an hour or 2 it seems so whenever I\u2019m at home about once a month I can give it a charge, maybe less frequently than that considering its strong battery life.\nThe ring app works smoothly and the lag is only about one second. Video and Audio quality are definitely a plus.\nA price of $50 and change per camera seems a fair deal in exchange for the additional layer of security. Especially with an upcoming holiday season.\nI\u2019ll update this review when I learn about the subscription services and what it entails.",

            "review_comment": "I have been wanting a video doorbell for several years, but the options are so overwhelming, I kept putting it off.  When this Ring battery doorbell went on sale, I bought it, spur of the moment, and I have zero regrets .  When I'm on the back patio, or in a room farther from the front door, I couldn't hear knocking on the door. I live in an apartment complex, so there's a lot of activity, and I have had so many packages stolen.  No more.  I reviewed the video regularly in the beginning, and shortly after packages arrive, there were various strangers coming to my door.  As soon as they see the Ring Doorbell, they walk away.  Battery life is great, I have it set to the most battery usage on every option, and after 44 days, battery still at 23%.  The option for a 2 way conversation has been super useful, as well as the option for leaving messages.  The sound and picture is perfectly clear.  I signed up for the Ring annual plan, and in my opinion, it's a great value, love the option to share video, as well as many other features. When comparing different video doorbells in the past I kept leaning towards cameras that didn't require a monthly fee, etc, but in the end I'm happy to pay for the convenience and extra features that Ring offers (give me convenience, or give me death \ud83d\ude1c.  The app is easy to use, set up simple and quick, and connecting to my Alexa speakers etc was seamless.  All around very satisfied with this doorbell.",

            "review_comment": "To start, buy the wired unit that comes with a rechargeable battery if you have an existing doorbell. Yes the 10 to 24 volt from your doorbell transformer will keep the battery charged. Yes the Ring doorbell will activate your existing doorbell chime so do not buy a separate chime. Don\u2019t panic when you first wire it to existing doorbell wires. Part of the install process is for th Ring doorbell to look for an existing chime and initialize or whatever it does to know it is there. Putting this in my review as I had a hard time finding this info on the vendor sites or any reviews.\nSetup is easy. The hardest part for my install was getting the mounting plate to be flat enough for the Ring doorbell to click into this mount. I have a stucco wall which creates flex in the mounting plate when attached. To get it to click I had to remove one of four screws and loosing others so that I could get my fingers on the back of the mounting plate to be able to get it flat to click to the doorbell. The mounting plate is plastic and easily flexes which will not allow the security snap to click into a locked position. Then to get the doorbell to not move, I added a shim behind.\nInstalled the doorbell is a bit clunky looking but video is good and works well taking video in the dark.\nHope this helps others.",

It picked up on the cats walking across the room multiple times a day. I'd say it's the best sensitivity of any doorbell cameras I've had experience with. The video quality is good and the sound quality was way better than expected. I talked to the cats and they could tell it was me and where the sound was coming from. I talked to my roommate through it and we could understand each other easily.\n\nThe free trial ran out, but the plans aren't expensive. The most basic one still gives all the great functions and is only $5/mo. Once we get it mounted outside I'll likely subscribe.",

It started charging perfectly (blue ring lighted and blinking).\nThe next day I realised that there weren't any notifications, and when I checked, it was \"offline\".\nNo response from the bell button.....it was dead.\nI removed it and plugged in the regular charger........nothing.....(yes, the charger is good.......the same one that was used to full-charge it when I got it).\nThat's it for me and RING. I'm gone.\nIf you opt for a solar charger, use one from RING themselves. Connecting anything else is at your own risk (and probable expense).\nShalom.\n\nUpdate (Edit).\n\nSo.......Ring reached out to me concerning my review. Phone calls, emails, ect.\nI explained the situation described above, and they promised to send me a new door bell, which they did.\nWhen I was about to set up the new one I noticed that the old (dead) one was showing full-charge on the app. I tried a reset (held both the orange And the bell buttons down simultaneously) and it came on. It came on and worked perfectly. I reinstalled it to its mount, and it's been going well ever since (approx a month).\nThe new (unopened) one? I promised the rep to ship it back to them. They \"can't provide a shipping label\" which they initially promised, and told me to keep the new one. I dont need nor want it. I tried to ship it back myself, but I'm not going to pay $140.00 to UPS it back to the States (I'm in the Caribbean).\nSo......5 stars \ud83c\udf1f it is for ring. Great product and support (subscription, history playback, etc).\nBattery is holding up well, and alerts are excellent (rarely misses).\nOnly connect chargers approved by them.\nShalom.\n\nP.S.\n\nWho need a  Ring doorbell for Christmas?",

            "review_comment": "I\u2019ve had the Ring Battery Doorbell for a few months now, and it has completely transformed the way I secure and monitor my home. As someone who values both convenience and safety, this doorbell has been a game-changer in terms of functionality, ease of use, and peace of mind.\n\nFirst, the installation was incredibly straightforward. I was able to set it up myself in about 20 minutes, thanks to the clear instructions and the fact that it's wire-free. The battery lasts surprisingly long too, even with regular motion detection and video use. I\u2019ve only had to recharge it a couple of times, and the process is quick and easy.\n\nThe video quality is excellent\u2014crystal clear even in low light, which is essential for those early morning or late-night deliveries. The wide-angle lens gives a clear view of who\u2019s at the door, and the motion detection feature is spot-on. I get instant alerts on my phone whenever someone is approaching, and I love that I can see and speak to visitors directly through the app. Whether I\u2019m at home or out running errands, I can easily communicate with delivery people or guests, which is great for convenience and security.\n\nAnother feature I love is the two-way audio. The sound quality is surprisingly clear on both ends, and I\u2019ve been able to have full conversations with delivery drivers, neighbors, and even the occasional solicitor. The built-in siren also offers an added layer of security\u2014if I ever feel unsafe, I can sound it directly from the app.\n\nThe Ring app itself is intuitive and user-friendly, with everything you need in one place. You can review video clips, adjust settings, and even link it with other smart devices for an integrated security system. It\u2019s so easy to use, even for someone who isn\u2019t particularly tech-savvy.\n\nIn summary, the Ring Battery Doorbell has exceeded my expectations. It\u2019s reliable, easy to install, and provides real-time alerts that help keep my home secure. The video quality and two-way communication make it stand out among other doorbell cameras, and I feel much more confident knowing I can monitor my doorstep from anywhere. If you're looking for a high-quality, user-friendly doorbell camera that doesn\u2019t require complicated wiring, this is definitely worth the investment!",

Unfortunately, his camera didn't catch everything that happened. I was so mad because this is the second time one of my vehicles have been vandalized. I got on Amazon and brought two Ring Flood Lights and this Ring doorbell - and haven't had a chance to even use it fully yet. Like my title says, you have to think installation before just buying security cameras and door bells. You will have to first, charge the ring doorbell battery and then drill holes to install the backing to whatever surface or object it will be mounted on. To my sad realization...I did not have a drill to install the doorbell...so it's just recording the inside of its box until my drill is delivered (coming tomorrow btw)...but I gave the item 4 stars because I believe that should sorta be expressed - INSTALLATION...you either need to drill or buy a door mount sleeve for the doorbell (that you would have to pay separately for) AND on top of that...you will have to buy the door chime separately too. I know this was long winded, but I hope this helps the next person who decides to buy.",

            "review_title": "The Answer: How often to really change filter",
            "review_comment": "First off, this filter is great.  It does exactly what it's supposed to and does it well for quite a while.  A couple of questions always come up around these things and I will try to answer them to the best of my knowledge as an engineer, and what I do for my family to keep them safe, but always do your own research because it's your water!\n\nPro-Tips Q&A:\n\nQ. When my light turns on in the refrigerator that says \"Change Filter\", is the filter really worn out vs they just want me to buy a new one like a subscription service?\n\nA. The answer to this is a frustrating \"It depends\".  Some refrigerators just turn on the light every X amount of hours of run time, usually around 4380 (six months).  Others measure how many gallons of water you have used and then turn on the light (usually around 200-250 gallons) but I have never seen one that measures ONLY gallons.  Some really new ones measure flow rate as a third indicator and when the flow changes by a certain percent it might trigger a filter change light because the computer assume that the filter is not doing its job any longer.\n\nThere may be a rating printed right on the filter to check how many gallons it's good for.  Most newish models fridges in the last 10-15 years watch both hours and gallons and turn on the light whatever is happens first, 6 months or 200 gallons.  The newest watch flow, gallons and time and will act accordingly.  I have one newer fridge that will turn on the light within a month if you use a cheap knock off.  I don't use this fridge for water or ice so it doesn't matter, but the flow of the knock-offs is effected such that the fridge believes that it isn't getting filtered properly and with these cheap knock-offs it's probably right so I went back to OEM even on that fridge and I just change it once per year and I'm done with it.  Safety first even if I don't plan to use it!\n\nQ. So if I am not using 200 gallons, do I need to replace it every six months?\n\nA. The answer is again, it depends.  Here is where it gets tricky.  How bad is the water coming in, and how much sediment and other things are you filtering out?  In other words, how hard are you working the filter?  The carbon in the filter only has so much capacity to absorb stuff.  At some point it becomes less effective and the water just passes through without being filtered because the carbon is saturated and can't handle any more.\n\nThe way I figured out what was right for me was I checked my water with those water check strips you can get here on Amazon, and I figured out exactly how bad the water was and what was in it.  Then I figured out how that compared to the average water across the U.S. domestic market (EPA numbers) and I figured out my water was somewhat cleaner than then average but also on the hard side.  This gives you your base to know around how much the filter will likely absorb.  If you figure the manufacturer assumes 200 gallons of average water, and you can adjust if yours is above or below average.  I figured in my case these OEM filters were in fact good for around 268 gallons without an issue, assuming they were in fact honest and 200 gallons was the right starting point (slight leap of faith there).  That was a 30%+ increase beyond the recommended number.  Using up my box of test strips basically proved it out although I figure around 250 gallons or so it would start to show less effective.\n\nFor the refrigerator that this particular filter is going into, it's not seeing 200+ gallons in a year.  Remember: Include ice creation in your water calculation.  Therefore for me, and this refrigerator (vs my others) I could get away with replacing the filter only once per year.\n\nQ.  Why not go over a year and wait until 200+ gallons????\n\nA.  Well that is because it is possible that bacteria can grow in the carbon and get transferred to the water.  This is unlikely, but possible and as the bacteria take up space itself (very little) you can make the filter less effective AND less safe, so I change it at LEAST once a year just to be safe.  The carbon in a solid state like in these filters does not break down when exposed to water so I don't have to calculator that.\n\nQ.  Why not use a cheaper knock-off filter at half the price and replace it twice as often, or at a 1/4 the price and replace it twice as often saving lots of money?  Well, for me, I don't trust what these knock-off filters claim.  Some of the claims are so outrageous I am surprised they don't claim it cures cancer.  You find these on the Chinese knock-offs in particular.  Avoid these at all costs.  Some of the more reputable filter replacements are probably ok, but they might skimp on carbon, or have wider channels so there is less carbon, use a different density carbon etc. that may make them cheaper but less effective.  The only way to tell for sure is to take water measurements and then cut the filter open to see for yourself across samples taken over a 6 month period.  That is a heck of a lot of work when I know that I am replacing them at the right interval, plus I know for sure the OEM manufacturer doesn't want to get sued or take a reputational risk so their specs are likely correct.  I want to keep my family safe, so I just go with the OEM version and make my calculations.\n\nRemember, you are DRINKING this.  Either in frozen Ice form or liquid form.  Your family, your children, your guests, friends, relatives drink this.  Spend a little extra money to get a filter you know works and will be safe for your family.\n\nI hope you found this helpful.",

I can pop around the kitchen easily without needing to turn any big lights on.\n\nInstalling them was super easy! Literally just peel & stick the magnets on the back. You can also pull the lights off the magnets to clean and charge if needed. But the magnets are stuck to the bottom of the cabinets. I don\u2019t intend to remove them, but it is a very strong adhesive so I potentially wouldn\u2019t recommend if you\u2019re a renter or would expect to need to fully remove them.\n\nThe only reason I retract one star is because they are motion sensor activated, but they turn on regardless of other lighting in the kitchen. So this will drain the battery a bit faster than I\u2019d expect. We walk by them multiple times every day and have to charge them about every two weeks. But each light came with its own charging cord, so I\u2019ve just added plugging them in to my Sunday bedtime routine! By the time I wake up the next morning they\u2019re full charged!

Rather than pay an expensive electrician to install permanent light fixtures I wanted to give these a try.  They work GREAT!  Exactly what I needed, I use the auto light setting and they all pop on when the door is opened and turn off when no motion is detected or the panty door is closed.  The light is the perfect brightness on the highest setting for my needs, and I installed them on the underside of the shelf above in the time it takes to peel off a sticker.  Easy to install and they came with an extra set of the magnet stickers so you could move them around if you like.  The magnets work perfectly and hold them in place after they were stuck onto a wood painted shelf.  It also came with a few screws to mount them, but why hassle with that when the stickers work just fine!\n\nAnother great feature is no batteries needed!!  I have used other small motion lights in this cabinet that required batteries, super expensive and they faded fast.  Very pleased with this product and the price can't be beat!!  When recharging, a light turns from red to green and they charge pretty quickly.",

            "review_comment": "Our old house had two LED strips that plugged into outlets so we would flip two switches to turn them on in the evening and shut them off at night. But the strip would not work in the new house because the cabinets are different heights and depths. I paid $12 for each rechargeable light so $24 per two pack. I bought just 2 lights to make sure we liked them then ordered 10 more. We have used them for a month and like them; brightness is good; very easy to install; some reviews complained about the mount falling off but not an issue (maybe they did not put them on correctly); i set one light to max brightness and it lasted 10 hours; yes it's a pain to turn on 12 switches every evening but that only takes 30 seconds; we end up charging 3-4 lights each day so I bought a \"MaxLax USB Charger Station,10-Port 50W/10A\" for $12 so there's enough ports to also charge two phones and other gadgets.\n\nInstall: Cabinets are wood but rather than use the screws to mount the plates I stuck the sticky side of the plates to the wood. After you remove the plastic from the two mounts, put the mounts on the back of the light (light is held to mounts by a magnet) with the sticky side up. Then get the light in place under the cabinet and push up on the whole thing- light with mounts attached, and the mounts will stick. Do not try to attach mounts without the light because it's impossible to line them up correctly. I wanted each light two inches from the front edge of the cabinet so every time I stuck my hand under there the switch would be in the same place. I taped a 2 inch scrap of wood under the cabinet and mounted the light right next to it- that also kept the lights straight. After the first light I did not even bother with the tape- I just held the block in place then smushed the mounts to the cabinet. After they are charged, I put them back under the cabinet with the switch always on the right side so i do not have to guess which end to look for the switch on.\n\nSpecs: Lights are 10 inches long and 8 inches of that is the LEDs. They have a low profile so you do not see them under the cabinet. When we found we had to charge the lights every few days (we were hoping for once a week) I looked into the 1800 mAh spec which is some measure of the battery, and I found similar lights with up to 5,000 mAh. But they had the exact same \"lasts up to 8 hours on max brightness.\" I think because they had more LEDs or put out more light- the battery was better but it did not extend the max time before needing a charge. I finally found a light about the same size with a 4,200 mAh battery that lasts 20 hours but it's $20.\n\nSo the drawbacks are turning on and off so many switchs and having to charge them. But it only took a couple minutes to install one light- I installed all 12 in less than an hour. I guess I could have bought one 20 inch light for the bigger cabinets and had three less switches, but these were a good price. These would be perfect for use in a pantry, closet, over the utility sink in the laundry room- not really bright enough to put over a workbench, but if you set them to auto, every time you open the pantry door or use the sink in the laundry room you can see what you're doing. And with the light on auto it should only need to be charged once or twice a month.",

            "review_comment": "We have always been disappointed with the dark areas underneath our kitchen cabinets. Getting an electrician to run wires for undercabinet lights would have cost a fortune.\n\nWe bought three boxes, six total light strips of the 14.7 inch models. Installing them was easy, as long as you are careful. Misreading the instructions can cause someone to have difficulty attaching them using  the sticky strip. Fortunately, they provide extra strips if an error is made.\n\nHere's some installation tips if you are going to use the sticky strip.\n1. Unpack the box making sure that all the components are present.\n2. Get ready to fully charge each unit, being 'careful' to use the correct charger. Using one with too high a voltage and amperage may damage the strip. I used a USB Charger Block,5V 1A Wall Charger that puts out the correct power supply. Charge each unit until the green light comes on.\n3. Determine where you wish to place them. If on the bottom of wooden kitchen cabinets, clean the wood to remove any grease buildup that may  have formed. Dove dishwashing soap in water works well. Dry each surface.\n4. Remove the clear plastic film off the light (the side where the switch and charging light is).\n5. Place the unit on a clean, smooth, firm surface light side down.\n6. Notice that each end has 'U' shaped magnet symbols. The small rectangular magnetic strips must ultimately be place directly over each 'U' symbol.\n7. Remove the 'BLUE' film of each strip 'first'.\n8. Then place that side down onto the 'U' symbol making sure it fits down within the slightly depressed culvert-like placement guides.\n9. After you align the magnetic strips in the correct position on top of the 'U' symbol. double check to make sure the white paper side of the magnetic strips are facing up towards you.\n10 Carefully use a fingernail to gently remove the white paper covering, exposing the tacky surface. Try not to touch the tacky surface with your fingers. That tacky surface will hold the unit in place onto the underside of the cabinet.\n11. Determine orientation where you want to have it 'exactly' adhere to the cabinet, because once you push the light strip firmly onto the wood surface, you will not be able to move it without damaging the magnetic/adhesion strips. If you do damage them, remember there are two spares included with each box.\n12. Push each light unit onto the wood surface on the underside of each cabinet.\n13. Use the switch to set the light to 'automatic', 'on', or 'off'.\n14 Enjoy your lights.",

I haven't used it in years because I hated the tubes always going bad or flickering.  After using these for other purposes I decided to use them for under cabinet lighting.  The 15 second motion timer is annoying so when I'm working in the kitchen I just turn on the ones in the area where I'm working to stay on.\n\n  The 10 inch  model is 10 inches, however the 14 inch model is a little longer, not quite 15 inches, but more than 14.  The 14 inch models are brighter obviously.\n\n So far the metal plates that come with the unit have held to the cabinets just using the sticky adhesive, and I haven't had to use the little screws.  If the adhesive fails I'll just go get some command strips, not a fan of making holes in my cabinets even if they are tiny.\n\n  I have found other used where these come in handy, stick them to any ferrous metals.  I've put them on my door that goes into the garage, I've also put them on the metal vertical braces on my garage door.  Great to have if the power ever goes out.",

I\u2019ve noticed a significant improvement in air quality within just a few days of using them. They really help with reducing allergens, which has made a noticeable difference in my household.\n- **Easy to Install:** The 16x24x1 size fits perfectly in my HVAC system, and installation was a breeze. I had all six filters swapped out within minutes.\n- **Durable and Long-Lasting:** Even after a full month of use, the filters are still performing well. They don\u2019t clog up too quickly, which means I don\u2019t have to change them as often as some other brands. They seem sturdy and built to last.\n- **Value for Money:** Buying a 6-pack is incredibly convenient and cost-effective. I don\u2019t have to worry about restocking for months, and the price per filter is a great deal compared to buying them individually at a store.\n- **Improved Airflow:** Even though the filters capture a lot of particles, they don\u2019t restrict airflow in the house. The HVAC system is running efficiently, and there\u2019s no noticeable strain.\n\n**Cons:**\n- **Packaging:** The only minor issue is that the filters could be packaged a little more securely. When they arrived, a couple of the filters were slightly bent on the edges. It didn\u2019t affect the performance, but sturdier packaging would be appreciated.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nI\u2019m extremely happy with these Filtrete filters. They\u2019re reliable, durable, and do a fantastic job at improving air quality. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality air filter to keep your home\u2019s air clean and fresh, this 6-pack is a fantastic buy. Highly recommend!",

            "review_comment": "I purchased this white 6 pack and the brown 6 pack in hopes of understanding the 4 to 6 dollar difference between the white Filtrete MERV 5. While I believe the filter media are very similar, I was interested in increasing filtering quality while moving up from fiberglass style (MERV 3 ish). I could never find a fiberglass style in my price point with a more sturdy frame. The frame of the brown one is very similar to the fiberglass usually designed to be nested within one another and takes up less space for storage. The nested cardboard frame seams to lend its self to be less robust, more wiggle or floppy. My fear would be collapse into the air handler.\n\nThe fiberglass style would have to have years of blockage to even consider getting stucked in. The MERV 5 and up would be more sensitive to sooner blockage just because the filter media is of tighter construction hence  more particular capture. Regardless, I go no more than 2 months  per filter even fiberglass. The fiberglass will have the highest flow throughout the life because it's media is inherently less restrictive.\n\nNow to the white Filtrete. This frame is much more robust and doesn't doesn't lend its self to nesting even though it has the exact same design. The cardboard is similar to soft drink 12, 24, and 36 pack can containers. This cardboard has a glossy finish probably on top of the brown cardboard, makeing it a more stiff and moisture resistant. I hope they don't change the paper formulation for the white frame.\n\nThe fit, installation and function of either the brown or white will be just as easy and filtering quality will be very similar.\n\nNow for the price difference I returned the brown and request the white. To me the white is a better quality with the filtration qualities I need. The extra 4 to 6 dollars is well spent for peace of mind. Check out the pictures for more detail. I hope this helps you choice.",

I appreciate each contains a coin battery since each of these miniature candles costs up to and over five bucks each for a replacement.

Simply remove the old filter, align the new one, and click it into place.

Just peel off the tin foil cover on the top of the filter, fill the new filter to the top with tap water and screw it in the holder in the refrig. Drew off two large glasses of water and by then the \"sputtering\" had stopped and I was back in operation. Last thing to do was resetting the red \"replace filter\" LED warning light.\n\nLiterally took 30 seconds and didn't spill a single drop of water although I had put a dishcloth under the old filter before I removed it based on some other folks claiming they got water all over the inside of their refrig. Obviously user error. When the old filter is unscrewed, a check valve shuts off the water supply to the filter. I think the folks with problems pushed up on the new filter when trying to screw it in; thus, unseating the check valve and spraying water inside their refrig. Don't do that...just let the threads on the filter do the work as you screw it in the mount.\n\nAmazon's price was competitive with other discounters, shipping was free and I received the filter in five days.\n\nWhat's not to like about the Amazon ordering process? Absolutely nothing!\n\nThe old filter lasted 10 months (family of three) and I just put an alert in my computer to order a new filter in nine months so I'll have one on hand the next time.",

Some reviews (elsewhere) and user comments said that not replacing the filter causes the system to shut down via an RFID chip in the filter. Indeed there is a warning label behind the filter regarding RFID.  Since we have a hole house pre-filter, we don't feel the need to replace our filter more often than every 1-2 years. I've asked for a replacement filter to be resent and I'm sending the new one that doesn't work back (high-5 amazon!).  These filters are wayyyyy to pricey to be jacking us around like this, if not replacing does indeed shut down our water and ice dispensing GE execs should be fined and jailed.",

It is extremely dense and settles really well in place when wind is light.  It is so dense that it can really limit visibility when it builds up in areas.  It is completely odorless and very clean, but does leave some residue after several hours of use in fog output hoses.  It is very clean cycling through 1000 watt fog machines and had no issues with them the entire time using this fluid.",

I chose the smaller quart size to start, but I love that I can scale up for larger events. The liquid isn\u2019t thick and messy at all. It pours out quick like water.\n\nThe bottle came securely sealed, which is always a plus, and there\u2019s absolutely no smell to the liquid\u2014something I really appreciate since it will be used at my roller rink. I can\u2019t wait to try it out and see how the fog performs with this product.\n\nSo far, it seems like a great purchase at a fantastic price!

The video was taken on a very windy night, but the fog is very thick and provided exactly the effect I was going for. There were no chemical smells. My husband tested it indoors and it got a little crazy in the house, very strong fog.\n\nThe fog machine was defective, so we didn't get to use all of the liquid...booo. Someone else mentioned that this fog liquid can be diluted with distilled water as it may be too strong for some machines, which makes me wonder if that's what was causing my machine to malfunction, which I already returned, so no chance of testing that.\n\nOverall, this fog liquid worked exactly as described. Next Halloween, I'll get the large gallon size.",

These strings are perfect for my playing style, especially if you're into rock, blues, or any genre that needs a bit of extra punch. The 11-48 gauge strikes a nice balance between thickness and playability, giving me just the right amount of tension for both rhythm and lead playing.\n\nThe tone is fantastic\u2014bright, clear, and full-bodied, without being too harsh. They really bring out the best in my guitar, and I love how consistent the sound stays over time. I\u2019ve had these strings on for a few weeks now, and they haven\u2019t lost their brightness or gotten overly dull like some other brands I\u2019ve tried. Plus, the nickel-wound construction gives them a smooth feel, and they stay in tune well, even with heavy strumming or bending.\n\nI also appreciate the durability of these strings. I tend to play a lot, and these Power Slinkys hold up surprisingly well. They\u2019re definitely more resilient than some of the other strings I\u2019ve used in the past. Overall, I highly recommend these strings for any guitarist looking for great tone and long-lasting performance without breaking the bank. They\u2019ve definitely become my go-to!",

I have been playing GHSboomers Custom Lights (9-46) and EB Hybrid Slinky\u2019s (9-46) since 1985\u2026\nMost of my guitars are tuned to dropC# on 6string and Drop AD on 7tring.\nThe main difference between the boomers and slinky\u2019s is Round Core vs Hex Core. I prefer the RoundCore boomers for dropC# or even DropC as the output of each string actually generates more power and slightly less noise whereas the slinky\u2019s ARE yep, more slinky (ever so slightly more flexible at the same tuning which is really only noticeable on the wound strings)\u2026\nMy son sent me the link because it is/was a fantastic price\u2026 3pack for the price of 1pack, and even though I would NOT switch to Primo Slinky 9.5-44, they are perfect for my dozens of guitars I don\u2019t play that need new strings occasionally.\n\nWhat do they feel like?They feel like Daddario 9\u2019s.\nIt feels like the hex cores of these Primo Slinky\u2019s 24/34/44 wound strings are the exact cores of the Super Slinky 24/32/42\u2026\n\nSo, IF you currently play either 9\u2019s or 10\u2019s, and the price is still $6.99 for a 3pack, you won\u2019t regret buying them for a second!!",

The directions are a bit vague and the black box with the red button that plugs into the machine they wrongly call a remote control and it's confusing because there is a wireless remote that comes with it too. All the led lights work but it was daylight in the house when I tested it and I never planned on using the Leds as I was going to use it with a laser. It seems like it will go through fluid faster then you think so make sure you buy a couple bottles of juice or a gallon of it.

However shortly after the fluid ran out and i heard the pump start to whine. The next day I took it apart and found the tank capacity to be very small.  Found a tank from an old fog machine and connected it. Poured the fog juice from the original container to the spare one. The fluid level only went to the level my finger was at in the picture. If you are going to sell a fog machine with a continuous mode, you should have more fluid capacity built in.",

I personally believe that they should include three long wires so that everything can be charged at once for later use. Other than that everything is awesome!

Some of the reviews about volume and not really capturing your voice on the tech side scared me. I decided to go for it, because I liked the bluetooth feature and how it's a speaker as well. As an aspiring singer, I like holding my microphone while I record on music apps. It makes me feel official singing in my bathroom lol.\n\nI told myself even if the mic itself is not loud, I will atleast have a nice prop. So I bought two... I'm planning a karaoke night with friends. Let me tell ya, this microphone exceeded my expectations. Is it stadium loud? No. Do you have to turn the volume and music button almost to the max to hear well? Yes. But does it work good yes. Volume is good, speaker is great for the size!\n\nMy mom and I were dancing in the kitchen to a Anthony Hamilton song (\"The Best of Me\") that it played through Spotify. It works with my music app Star Maker amazingly, YouTube and more. Again do not expect a \"star quality\" concert microphone. This is great tool to have fun singing or listening to music by yourself or with friends. So if you are on the fence do not hesitate.\n\nGet yours today! Oh did I mention that I love it\ud83d\ude01!!!\nFYI: the green is my favorite. It's a beautiful cool green tone. Soo relaxing to look at... And the blue clearly looks nothing like their ad. It's more of a sky blue. Ooh I can't wait till karaoke night\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffe!!",

I bought this for my wife for Christmas and to my surprise her cloddish brother snatched it from her hands inviting all kinds of sibling rivalry resentments to the center of our jovial celebrations. He instinctively began divulging the most basic of thoughts as he encountered them like some torturous streaming of consciousness. Soon after the toy disappeared for many weeks\u2026 until it was new year\u2019s, my wife had been drinking since noon, and her inner diva demanded dominion. She and one of her best friends sprung out before all our guests and began screeching and wailing some butchered versions of a fleetwood mac song. The grip of trauma raced around the room like an evil spirit trying to possess us, evident by the wave of soured faces. Our guests demanded they stop the torment or they\u2019d leave. I was elated when my wife through all manner of infantile protestations relented and released us from our pain. Until ten minutes later when she and her friend bust out again like the opening act for hell. And so our guests stormed off writhing in agony. However after they had finished a tenth song of utter musical calamity they invited other weary family to join in the mayhem. The device itself does not produce a full musical sound. It is flat and sounds a bit like music is being played in a different room. However it does make clear the song and does deliver clearly the voice being sung. We haven\u2019t used any of the effects yet. It paired easily with different phones and we were able to find ample songs with lyrics on Apple Music and YouTube. Once those two banshees had finished that is when the joy begun. Suddenly we were all romantically falling into the abyss of our dreams as celebrated singers. We hit the high notes, dazzled on the runs and belted with great passion the essence of truth of the songs we sung. Suddenly our captors had become our creators and we could rejoice with them in their songs too. It was a strange pivot to experience. We sang gleefully into the new year with abandon and love for the songs we cherished. My recommendation is to get one, sing to your heart\u2019s content and let the scoffers be damned.",

It's the kind of accessory you didn't know you needed until you had it, and it added so much fun to our trip. Each lady purchased a different color. First off, the portability of this microphone is a major win. It's compact, lightweight, and fits easily into a small bag, making it the ideal travel companion. We carried it around effortlessly, whether we were exploring the city, lounging on the beach, or having late-night karaoke sessions in our cozy Airbnb. The sound quality was surprisingly impressive for a device of this size. It delivered crystal-clear sound, which was perfect for impromptu sing-alongs and capturing the laughter and chatter of our group. Plus, it's compatible with smartphones, so we were able to record our adventures and preserve our favorite moments with ease. The wireless connectivity was a game-changer. It meant no fumbling with cords or being tethered to a speaker. We could pass the mic around or dance around it, adding a whole new dimension to our party nights and outdoor escapades.\nThe battery life exceeded our expectations. It lasted all day and then some, so we never had to worry about it running out of juice in the middle of the fun. Charging was quick, which was a lifesaver. But what truly set this microphone apart was the versatility. It had built-in effects, like reverb and echo, which allowed us to channel our inner pop stars and create entertaining vocal performances. It even doubled as a Bluetooth speaker for our playlists. In summary, this microphone was an unexpected highlight of our girls' trip. It added a layer of fun, entertainment, and memories that we'll cherish forever. If you're planning a getaway with friends and want to take your adventures to the next level, this microphone is a must-have. It's versatile, portable, and endlessly entertaining. Our trip wouldn't have been the same without it, and I can't recommend it enough for anyone seeking to amplify their travel experiences.",

Nice bright sound a little more string screech than my go to brand ernie ball earthwoods and they seem to go out of tune a little quicker for the first few days. They still sound bright and have good warmth  after 2 weeks and they hold a tune just fine, so Id say they have proven durability. Great value for the money.

            "review_comment": "That might sound too drastic, but...\nI was replacing a set of Elixirs out of which I got 2,5 months of daily playing.  I put on strings from low E to high E, getting each string in tune before I put on the next one.  As I was tuning the G string, D string which I tuned right before it suddenly snapped. What the hack? I've been playing this particular guitar since 2012, but I decided to examine the G tuner hole to see if there was something wrong with its edge, but it was fine. So there goes another string from a different pack.\nNow on to the way they sounds on my jumbo Alvares. The sound is unbalanced, over bright, lacks in bass and is forced.\nBut the true problem with these strings that they can only be played with a pick. I spend more time playing fingerstyle and these strings are like a perfect chainsaw for fingernails. Would I ever buy these string again? No. Would I put them on my guitar if somebody gave them to me as a gift? No. Would I give them to somebody as a gift? Well if I wouldn't like the person that they were going to strangulate with these strings - I would!\n2 stars\n\nAmendment 1\nAfter several weeks of playing I actually like the played-in sound.\nUpgrading my vote to 3 stars.\n\nAmendment 2\nThese strings still ruin my nails like no other strings ever have, when I strum strum them without a pick. But that aside, after two months of playing them daily with sweaty fingers, they still sound neither dull or nor muffled, but rather surprisingly pleasant and balanced.  My favorite Elixir Polyweb would have lost their original sound by now and their famed coating would have pealed  and be hanging off the strings. But these strings just keep going.\nUpgrading my vote to 4 stars.\n\nAmendment 3\nFeb 1 2023\nAll right - it has been three months of playing these strings, at least an hour every day. And - despite them even sometimes being exposed to my cheddary fingers (wine + cheese + guitar), they still sound GOOD.\nThis is truly remarkable. Yes, Polyweb keeps the bright side of played-in sound longer, but no strings have ever kept it up to such abuse without sounding like a dying cat. (I love cats.)",
